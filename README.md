# CLRS-js

This repository contains JavaScript solutions to *CLRS (3rd Edition)*, a.k.a, *Introduction to Algorithms (3rd Edition) by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein*.

Currently this project is still far from completed (and probably will take very very long time). It will be very grateful if you can star this repository, and it will be more grateful if you'd like to contribute. You are welcome to:

1. Point out mistakes and bugs
2. Add new tests
3. Add new solutions
4. Add more detail explanations about solutions

P.S. If you are going to submit a new solution, make sure to add sufficient tests please!
